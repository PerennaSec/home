My approach to implementing my workstation's firewall was, in essence, my approach to all aspects of its construction: **default deny**. When I set myself upon building my hardened Gentoo daily-driver, I wanted to be as paranoid as possible. While it's widely understood that the internet is a hostile environment, my goal was to behave as though this hostile environment was enhanced. As though the eyes of the Dragnet were mobilized upon me. 

My chief guide in this endeavor was Gentoo community mainstay, user pietinger and his Installation Guide for Paranoid Dummies (https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1112798.html). Module B1 describes a secured network setup, insulated from both outside *and* inside threats, utilizing `privoxy` and `iptables`. After installing and initializing a proxy (as well as confirming the required kernel modules are installed), users are advised of the firewall's basic operational principle. 

Simply put, incoming packets are allowed for existing connections only. If a connection was not initiated from the workstation, incoming transmissions would be blocked. With this established, the user then explicitly allows outgoing connections from defined ports. At the **very** least this includes DNS, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and SMTP, though daily-driver use obviously necessitates much more. 

Also of note is the absence of complex chain-based rules, often seen in `iptables` and `nftables` setups. Because this is a workstation that implicitly denies all unapproved connections, it is sufficient to flush the tables before utilizing the `iptables -A` command to append our rules to a blank ruleset. 

A bash script is provided to automate what would otherwise be a lengthy and error-prone process. Examining its syntax and commands, it's easy to extrapolate what is needed for full desired workstation functionality. 

After establishing basic log functionality and setting default chain rules, as well as allowing loopback, established, and related connections, the user is able to quickly place in their own commands. See code snippets below:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Log Function
logit="-j LOG --log-prefix"

# Flush current iptables rules and set default policy to DROP
iptables -F
iptables -X
iptables -Z
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Allow loopback traffic
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow established and related connections
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED,INVALID -j ACCEPT

# Allow traffic to and from Wireguard interface
iptables -A INPUT -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o wg0 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 51820 ${logit} "[ACCEPT OUT] WG0: "
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 51820 -j ACCEPT

# Allow Privoxy
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8118 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8118 -j ACCEPT
```

```sh
# Allow VirtualBox Interfaces
iptables -A INPUT -i vboxnet0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o vboxnet0 -j ACCEPT

# Allow Spiderfoot
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 5001
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 5001

# Drop Packets Related to Windows Network Discovery (Enable if Windows is on the Network)
iptables -A INPUT      -p udp --dport 137 -j DROP      # netbios-ns
iptables -A INPUT      -p udp --dport 138 -j DROP      # netbios-dgm
iptables -A INPUT      -p udp --dport 67 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT      -p udp --dport 68 -j DROP

# Allow Mail Functionality
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 587 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 465 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 110 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 995 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 143 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 993 -j ACCEPT

# Drop and log all other traffic
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "[DROP] IN: "
iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "[REJECT] OUT: "
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -j REJECT
iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP

# Save iptables rules
iptables-save > /etc/MY/fwrules
```
*(my full firewall script can be found here: https://github.com/PerennaSec/rootscripts/blob/main/fw-set.sh)*

All of these are fairly standard ports and interfaces, to be expected on many setups. Note the Wireguard and Virtualbox commands, as well as the block at the end to block, reject, and log all non-matched traffic. But what happens when non-standard ports and services are used? For example, I'm not immediately aware of which ports are used by Minecraft, or 0AD, though I know I'll need to access them if I would like multiplayer functionality. 

Enter ChatGPT. Being an LLM, ChatGPT is optimized to work with the logical and syntactical operations of programming languages. Just as well, while its use as a reference source definitely has its limits, utilizing ChatGPT for a simple port number lookup has shown consistent results. 

As the fledgling field of Prompt Engineering teaches, a language model such as ChatGPT thrives on context. It works best when it's told to act as a role, to generate a text-based works, or to reformat text into various standards. When you're able to narrow down its frame of reference and its goals, you're able to greatly improve the quality of the responses you receive. 

For example, when enlisting its help in designing my firewall, I gave the following prompt: "You are a systems administrator, implementing an iptables firewall via bash script. The firewall must implement a default deny policy. It must allow all incoming traffic from established and related connections, and log all explicitly allowed traffic. The following services or applications must be allowed through the firewall: system updates via emerge, git, rsync, ntp, dns, ssh, icmp, http, tor, qtwebkit, virtualbox, and wireguard. Produce a bash script to satisfy the stated requirements."

<!-- ![edit]({{ site.img_path }}/firewall/GPT2.png) -->
<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/firewall/GPT2.png" width="75%">

*Interestingly, when utilizing this prompt with GPT-3.5, the model first returns a script that includes the command `iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT`, which would violate the rules given above. The model can be told of its mistake, in which case it offers a corrected script.*

After establishing this context with the AI, one can continue to drill down into specifics and requirements for the task at hand. 

Using these generated scripts and port numbers, as well as the reference of seasoned users like pietinger, producing a script that satisfies necessarily strict security requirements becomes a straightforward process. Automating a kernel-level firewall ruleset via bash script proves not only efficient but more secure, as one is less prone to on-the-fly typing errors or bouts of forgetfulness. By using the straightforward syntax provided by `iptables`, one can fine-tune specific policy needs and log levels. Logs can then be imported into a SIEM for timeline data analysis, network baseline analysis, and more.
